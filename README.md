# Jetly Frontend

Jetly is a **Bitly-inspired URL shortener**.
This repository contains the **frontend application** built with **React** and **React Router**, providing an intuitive UI for managing shortened URLs.

The frontend is hosted on **Netlify** and communicates with the [Jetly Backend](https://github.com/joshualungido/url-shortener-be).

## üåç Subdomain-Based Architecture

Jetly separates the main dashboard and redirection service using **different subdomains** for cleaner routing and scalability.

### Structure

| Subdomain              | Purpose                                       | Example                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **[www](http://www).** | Frontend web app (dashboard, analytics, auth) | `https://www.jetly.app`          |
| **url.**               | Redirection service (handles short links)     | `https://url.jetly.app/PhKP0D31` |

### How It Works

When a user visits a short link like

```
https://url.jetly.app/PhKP0D31
```

the request is sent to the backend, which:

1. Looks up the original URL from the database using the short code (`PhKP0D31`).
2. Responds with an HTTP **302 Redirect** to the destination (e.g., `https://google.com`).

Spring Boot handles this automatically via:

```java
@GetMapping("/{shortUrl}")
public ResponseEntity<Void> redirect(@PathVariable String shortUrl) {
    var url = urlMappingService.getOriginalUrl(shortUrl);
    if (url != null) {
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.add("Location", url.getOriginalUrl());
        return ResponseEntity.status(302).headers(headers).build();
    }
    return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
}
```

### Why Use Subdomains?

‚úÖ **Separation of concerns** ‚Äì
Different subdomains for redirection and the main dashboard prevent routing conflicts between React and Spring Boot.

‚úÖ **Professional structure** ‚Äì
Matches industry-standard designs (like `bit.ly`), where the redirect and main site are distinct.

‚úÖ **Scalability & analytics** ‚Äì
You can apply different rate limits, tracking, and even host the redirect service independently for better performance.

‚úÖ **Security & flexibility** ‚Äì
Simpler SSL setup and easier to control which subdomain serves public traffic versus internal APIs.

Would you like me to make a **matching section** for your **backend README** too (explaining how the redirect controller and subdomain mapping work from the backend perspective)?
It‚Äôll make both repos consistent and easy for others to understand the full architecture.
